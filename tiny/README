Tiny Web server

This is the home directory for the Tiny server, a 200-line Web
server.  Tiny uses the GET method to serve static content
(text, HTML, GIF, and JPG files) out of ./ and to serve dynamic
content by running CGI programs out of ./cgi-bin. The default 
page is home.html (rather than index.html) so that we can view
the contents of the directory from a browser.

To install Tiny:
   Type "tar xvf tiny.tar" in a clean directory. 

To run Tiny:
   Run "tiny <port>" on the server machine, 
	e.g., "tiny 8000".
   Point your browser at Tiny: 
	static content: http://<host>:8000
	dynamic content: http://<host>:8000/cgi-bin/adder?1&2
